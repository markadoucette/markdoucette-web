## Key Implementation Details

### Custom Gradient System

Created a reusable gradient system in Tailwind config for consistent theming:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
plugins: [
  function ({ addUtilities }) {
    const newUtilities = {
      ".bg-gradient-light": {
        background: "linear-gradient(to right, white, #f9fafb)",
      },
      // Additional custom gradients...
    };
    addUtilities(newUtilities);
  },
];
```

### Interactive Career Timeline

Built a custom carousel component with:

- Mouse drag functionality
- Company selection highlighting
- Detailed accomplishments display
- Responsive navigation

### AI-Powered Support Automation

The Smart Ticket Analyzer demonstrates practical AI implementation:

```javascript
// Example: Dynamic API integration with real-time code generation
const searchStackOverflow = async (query) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.stackexchange.com/2.3/search?` +
      `order=desc&sort=relevance&site=stackoverflow&intitle=${query}`
  );
  return response.json();
};

// AI prompt engineering for consistent results
const analyzeWithClaude = async (contextData) => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/claude-analyze", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      prompt: buildAnalysisPrompt(contextData),
      model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
      temperature: 0.3,
      maxTokens: 1500,
    }),
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

**Key Features:**

- **Multi-API Integration**: Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Claude APIs
- **Real-time Code Generation**: Dynamic JavaScript code based on user inputs
- **Interactive Tutorial**: 6-step workflow with live demonstrations
- **AI Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts for consistent results
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Custom JavaScript tokenizer for code display
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management for API failures
- **State Management**: Complex React state for tutorial progression

### Type-Safe Development

Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for:

- Company experience data
- Social links and contact info
- Skills categorization
- Component props
- API response structures
- Tutorial step configurations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (required for dependencies)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git for version control

### Environment Variables

For the Smart Ticket Analyzer to work fully, you'll need:

```bash
VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
VITE_CLAUDE_API_URL=your_claude_api_endpoint
```

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/markadoucette/markdoucette-web.git
   cd markdoucette-web
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file with your API keys (optional - some features will be disabled without them)

4. **Start development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Deployment Process

This project uses AWS Amplify for hosting with automatic deployments:

### Initial Setup

1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect repository to AWS Amplify
3. Configure build settings for React/Vite
4. Set Node.js version to 20+ via environment variables
5. Add environment variables for API integrations

### Continuous Deployment

- Automatic builds triggered on every push to `main` branch
- Build process: `npm ci` ‚Üí `npm run build` ‚Üí deploy to CDN
- Typical deployment time: 3-5 minutes

### Custom Domain (Optional)

AWS Amplify supports custom domains with automatic SSL certificates.

## Lessons Learned

### TypeScript Configuration

- Encountered build issues with modern dependencies requiring Node.js 20+
- Solved TypeScript project reference conflicts during deployment
- Importance of cleaning unused imports for production builds
- Proper null safety handling for API responses

### API Integration

- Environment variable management across development and production
- Error handling for external API failures
- Rate limiting considerations for third-party services
- Proper authentication token management

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
- Careful consideration of component sizing across devices
- Balance between visual appeal and readability
- Complex interactive components that work on all screen sizes

### Performance Optimization

- Minimized bundle size by removing unused dependencies
- Efficient component structure to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Strategic use of images and icons
- Lazy loading for heavy interactive components
